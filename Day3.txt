Day 3 Solutions
Task 1
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?
Solution : 1/3

Task 2
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?
Solution : 12/51
           Explanation: 1. First time we can select any card from 52 cards so probability is 1
                        2. Second time we need to select card only from suit (selected previously) with (12 only left) from 51 cards
                        so final solution is 1 * 12/51 = 12/51
                        
Task 3 
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first 
marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?
Solution : 2/3
           Explanation : Similiar to Task 2.
