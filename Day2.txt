Task 1 Basic Probability
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9 .
Solution : Experiment: Toss of 2 six-sided dice
           Sample Space: No. of possible outcomes = 36
           Event : Sum at most 9
           Probability : 1 - 6/36  = 5/6
           
Task 2 More Dice
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will
be different and the two dice have a sum of 6. 
Solution : Experiment: Toss of 2 six-sided dice
           Sample Space: No. of possible outcomes = 36
           Event : Sum 6 & Different values on dice {(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)}
           Probability : 4/36  = 1/9
           
Task 3 Compound Event Probability
There are 3 urns labeled X,Y, and Z.

  X Urn contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
  Y Urn contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
  Z Urn contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?
Solution : Experiment: Drawing a ball from each urn
           Event : 2 Red and 1 Black {(R,R,B),(R,B,R),(B,R,R)}   R = Red, B = Black
           Probability : 4/7.5/7.4/8 + 4/7.4/9.4/8 + 3/7.5/9.4/8  = 51/126 = 17/42
